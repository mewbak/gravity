## Gravity Development Tools
For consistent tooling purposes across platforms all common Gravity development tooling is being put into ./developing/tools as go source files. You can run these tools by using ```go run ./developing/tools <command>```

Currently available GDT commands:  
   **apitrace**   -  trace full opengl state and opens qapitrace gui (requires apitrace)  
   **depgraph**   -  graphs package dependency relationships of Gravity (requires graphiz)  
   **genversion** -  generate the version.go source file for Gravity (requires git)
